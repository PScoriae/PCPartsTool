		A computer's internal components receive low-voltage, regulated DC power from a power supply
		unit (PSU), which converts mains AC. Switched-mode power supply are utilised by all contemporary
		personal computers. While some power supplies automatically adjust to the mains voltage, others
		offer a manual switch for choosing the input voltage.

		The ATX specification, which specifies form factor and voltage tolerances, is followed by the
		majority of contemporary desktop personal computer power supplies. The 5-volt standby (5VSB)
		power that an ATX power supply always supplies when it is connected to the mains supply powers
		the computer's standby features and some peripherals. A signal from the motherboard turns on and
		off ATX power supplies. In order for the computer to safely power on and boot, they also send a
		signal to the motherboard when the DC voltages are within specs. Version 3.0 of the ATX PSU
		standard is the most recent as of mid-2022.

		For the motherboard, CPU, and peripheral devices to operate, the desktop computer power supply
		transforms the alternating current (AC) from a wall socket of mains energy into a low-voltage
		direct current (DC). For the computer to operate steadily, a number of direct-current voltages
		must be present, and they must be precisely regulated. A single voltage supplied by a PSU is
		referred to as a power supply rail or voltage rail.

		Some power supply units (PSUs) can also provide a standby voltage, allowing the majority of the
		computer system to be switched down while getting ready for hibernation or shutdown and turned
		back on in response to an incident. If the motherboard supports it, standby power enables a
		computer to be started locally via Keyboard Power ON (KBPO) or remotely via wake-on-LAN and
		wake-on-ring. To save money and energy, the standby voltage may be produced by a tiny internal
		linear power supply or a switching power supply that shares some components with the main unit.
