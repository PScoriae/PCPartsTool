	The electronic equipment that carries out the instructions included in a software program is known
	as a central processing unit (CPU), sometimes known as a central processor, main processor, or
	simply processor. The CPU executes fundamental mathematical, logical, controlling, and
	input/output (I/O) activities as directed by the program's instructions. In contrast, specialised
	processors like graphics processing units and external components like main memory and I/O
	circuitry (GPUs).

	Although CPUs' shape, design, and implementation have evolved throughout time, their basic
	function has remained mostly same. The arithmetic-logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and
	logic operations, processor registers, which provide operands to the ALU and store the results of
	ALU operations, and a control unit, which coordinates the coordinated operations of the ALU,
	registers, and other components, are the main parts of a CPU. The control unit orchestrates the
	fetching (from memory), decoding, and execution (of instructions).

	With one or more CPUs on a single IC chip, integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors are how most
	current CPUs are implemented. Multi-core processors are microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs.
	Additionally, multiple virtual or logical CPUs can be created by multitasking the separate
	physical CPUs, or processor cores. [2]

	These integrated devices, also known as microcontrollers or systems on a chip, can include a CPU,
	memory, peripheral interfaces, and other computer parts (SoC).
