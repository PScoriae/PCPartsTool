		A motherboard is the primary printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other
		extensible systems. It is also referred to as a mainboard, main circuit board, mb, mboard,
		backplane board, base board, system board, logic board (only in Apple computers), or mobo. It
		provides connectors for various peripherals and retains and enables communication between many
		of the critical electronic parts of a system, including the memory and central processor unit
		(CPU). In contrast to a backplane, a motherboard frequently houses important sub-systems such
		the central CPU, input/output and memory controllers for the chipset, interface connectors, and
		other parts that are integrated for general usage.

		Specifically, a PCB with expansion capability is referred to as a motherboard. As implied by the
		name, this board is frequently referred to as the "mother" of all attached components, which
		frequently include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards, video cards,
		network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards, and a variety of other
		specialised components.

		Similar to that, the word "mainboard" refers to a single-board device without any other
		expansions or capabilities, such as the controlling boards in laser printers, televisions,
		washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded systems with constrained expansion
		capabilities.

		An electrical part that attaches to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and is intended to house a CPU
		is known as a CPU socket or slot (also called a microprocessor). It is a unique class of
		integrated circuit socket made for extremely high pin counts. In addition to providing a
		physical framework for the CPU, a CPU socket also supports a heat sink, makes replacement easier
		(and cheaper), and, most crucially, creates an electrical interface between the CPU and the PCB.
		Laptops often employ surface mount CPUs, but most desktop and server computers, especially those
		based on the Intel x86 architecture, have CPU sockets on the motherboard. A motherboard chipset
		and CPU socket type must be compatible. A CPU socket type and motherboard chipset must support
		the CPU series and speed.
