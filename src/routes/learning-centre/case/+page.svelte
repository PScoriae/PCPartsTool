		Most of the components of a personal computer are enclosed in a computer case, commonly referred
		to as a computer chassis (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse). Steel (commonly
		SECCâ€”steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled coil), aluminium, and plastic are typically used to
		make cases. In cases that were constructed at home, additional materials such as glass, wood,
		acrylic, and even Lego bricks, appeared.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cases can be found in a wide range of sizes (known as form factors). Since the motherboard is
		the most significant component of the majority of computers, its form factor typically dictates
		the size and shape of the computer case. The size of a case is another way to describe it (such
		as ATX case, Mini ITX case, etc.) As a result, personal computer form factors typically solely
		describe the internal layout and dimensions of the case. Due to the fact that these cases must
		themselves fit inside particular enclosures, form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may
		also have specified external dimensions.

		A case for an ATX motherboard and power supply, for instance, may have a variety of external
		shapes, including a vertical tower (designed to sit on the floor, height > width), a flat
		desktop (height width), or a pizza box (height 5 cm (2 in), designed to sit on the desk beneath
		the computer's monitor). In comparison to desktop cases, full-size tower cases often have a
		higher volume, providing additional space for drive bays, expansion slots, and bespoke or
		all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. When space is at a premium, desktop cases and
		mini-tower cases that are under 46 cm (18 in) high are preferred.

		The power supply unit and drive bays are typically enclosed in sheet metal, and computer cases
		also have a rear panel that can fit expansion slots and peripheral ports that protrude from the
		motherboard. In addition, most cases contain a power switch or button, a reset button, and LEDs
		to show power, hard drive activity, and in some models, network activity. Some cases have
		built-in I/O ports on the front of the case, including USB and headphone connectors. The wiring
		required to connect various ports, switches, and indicators to the motherboard will also
		typically be included in such a casing.
